# Lending_club_case_study
##Problem Statement
When a company gets a loan request, it must decide whether or not to approve the loan based on the applicant's profile. The bank's decision is related with two sorts of
risks:
1. If the candidate is likely to pay back the loan, the company will lose business if the loan is not approved.
2. Approving the loan may result in a financial loss for the company if the applicant is unlikely to pay back the loan, i.e. is likely to default.


##DataSet:
loan csv dataset


##The goal of case study:
The business goal is to identify high-risk loan applicants who are likely to default, and to reduce loan approval in order to reduce credit loss. 
These driving elements can be used by the organization to assess its business risk.

##Conclusion:
There are many more chances of defaulting. but the main factor is the applicant who has income 31201 to 58402.
